**Rjay1/Rjay1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a survey form and an esports quizz site.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS, Python, data structures and algorithms.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project relating to esports.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to become better at CSS and just design in general.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can become mediocre at anything pretty fast.
